### Big things
- Wayland support
  - Requires LayerShell protocol `zwlr_layer_shell_v1` to be supported by window manager
    - `zwlr_layer_shell_v1` is implemented by most window managers with the exception of Gnome 
  - Global Shortcut on Wayland is not yet implemented, please use `gauntlet open` CLI command to open main window

  - Settings UI overhaul
  - Slightly tweaked colors
  - Changed text selection color to make text more visible
  - Other minor style changes
- Theming support
  - 2 types of themes
    - Color only
    - Everything: Color, paddings, borders, etc
  - Theming is only applied to main window
  - Versioned
    - Because of internally invasive nature of the themes, it is perpetually unstable feature.
Themes are versioned and only one version is supported at the same time by application, the theme will stop working as soon as version is incremented
      - This may change in the future
  - See [THEME.md](./docs/THEME.md) for details
- It is now possible to change global shortcut for opening main window in settings
- Plugin shortcuts are now matched based on physical keycode, which means shortcuts now work regardless of selected keyboard layout

  - At the moment it is not possible to change this shortcut to different keys
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Implemented actual validation of `supported_system` plugin manifest property.
  - If OS was not specified in `supported_system` plugin manifest property, plugin will stop loading on that OS unless plugin is cross-platform (it doesn't have `environment`, `ffi`, `fs_read_access`, `fs_write_access`, `run_subprocess` or `system` permission) 

### Plugin Development
- Local plugin stdout `console.log` and stderr `console.error` logs are now saved to file to be able to show them in tools dev server CLI

### UI Improvements and Fixes
- Main window list is now scrolled automatically when using keyboard navigation to keep focused item visible

### General fixes
- Fix plugin toggle button to hide/show entrypoints in settings not doing anything

  - Note: port `42320` is still being used

## [5] - 2024-07-07

### Big changes

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Instead of separate binary for "frontend", frontend is now started by server in separate process on initial application launch
  - Global shortcut is available to show the application window. Currently, hardcoded to <kbd>META</kbd> + <kbd>SPACE</kbd>
  - In case window manager or underlying library we use doesn't support global shortcuts, `gauntlet open` command is also now available 
  - Unfortunately had to remove Wayland support for now, because GUI library we use, on Wayland doesn't support hiding/showing windows as well as setting window to be top-level
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Inter-process communication protocol has been changed from `DBus` to `gRPC`
  - To be able to support macOS and Windows easier in near future
  - Currently, 2 TCP ports are used and hardcoded to be `42320` and `42321`
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Plugins and plugin entrypoints now require description to be specified in plugin manifest
  - `gauntlet.description` and `entrypoint.*.description` keys are now required
  - Currently, only shown in Settings
- Actions can now be executed also using shortcuts
  - Shortcuts for specific entrypoint need to be specified in plugin manifest
  - Plugins are allowed to use only limited set of keys for shortcuts
    - Only upper and lower-case letters, symbols and numbers
  - Shortcut can have either `"main"` or `"alternative"` kind
    - `"main"` shortcut requires following modifiers
      - Windows and Linux: <kbd>CTRL</kbd>
      - macOS: <kbd>CMD</kbd>
    - `"alternative"` shortcut requires following modifiers
      - Windows and Linux: <kbd>ALT</kbd>
      - macOS: <kbd>OPT</kbd>
    - Whether <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> is also required depends on character specified for shortcut, e.g `$` will require <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> to be pressed, while `4` will not  
- 3 new bundled plugins
  - `Applications`
    - Collects and shows list of applications from systems as `"command"` entrypoints
    - "Gauntlet Application Launcher can now launch applications" :) 
    - Currently, only works on Linux
      - Collects `.desktop` files based on [Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html)
  - `Calculator`
    - Shows result of mathematical operations directly in main view under the search bar
    - Powered by [Numbat](https://github.com/sharkdp/numbat)
  - `Settings`
    - Allows to open Gauntlet Settings from the Gauntlet itself 
- Production React bundle is now used instead of Development bundle
  - Better performance
  - Worse error reporting
- Main window now has keyboard navigation
- It is now possible to remove plugins in Settings
- Plugin Entrypoints can now have icons
- Linux binary is now published inside `.tar.gz` file 

### API changes
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `"command"` entrypoint now expects function as default export instead of plain JS file
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Removed `<Content.Link>` React Component
  - `<Content>` is now expected to only contain non-interactive elements because of usage in `<Inline>` and `<Grid.Item>`
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `<MetadataIcon>` `icon` property type was changed to enum and renders to proper image of limited set of icons
- New `<List>` and `<Grid>` top-level React Components
- New `"inline-view"` entrypoint type
  - A view is rendered directly under main view search bar
  - Default export is expected to be a React Component that takes `text` string with current value of main search bar as single property
  - Child component is expected to be of type `<Inline>`
  - Used to implement built-in `Calculator` plugin but also available for any plugins to use
- New `"command-generator"` entrypoint type
  - Allows plugins to provide dynamically generated list of `"command"` entrypoints 
  - Used to implement built-in `Applications` plugin but also available for any plugins to use
- New `useNavigation` React Hook. Simple stack based navigation in plugins
- Plugins and plugin entrypoints can now have preferences
  - Need to be declared in plugin manifest
  - Values can be set either on first plugin/entrypoint usage (if preference is required) or in Settings
  - `pluginPreferences` and `entrypointPreferences` helper functions to retrieve values
- Plugins now have ability to provide assets in `assets` directory which later can be retrieved in JS using new `assetData` helper function
- Add `"title"` property to `Checkbox` React Component
  - It is shown to the right of the checkbox in forms
- `<Image>` is now properly implemented and has `source` prop of type `ImageSource` which is object that contains image binary data 

### UI/UX Improvements and Fixes
- Application window is now always show on top of all other windows
- Application now requests focus when the window is opened
- Application window is now re-centered when opening any plugin-rendered view 
  - Needed because plugin-rendered views make window bigger causing it to be not centered
- Show error in GUI when React rendering fails either because of plugin or Gauntlet itself
- Text now flows and wraps properly if multiple separate strings were passed as children parameter to `<Paragraph>` React Component 
- Entrypoint name is now shown at the bottom of every plugin-rendered view
- Clicking on `<Detail.Metadata.Link>` now properly opens links in your default browser 
- Plugin name in main view has been moved to the right side of the window
